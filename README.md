## Installation

Ensure you have Rust installed. If not, follow the instructions at [https://rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install).

To build and install `llm_globber`, use Cargo, Rust's package manager:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This command builds an optimized executable in the target/release/ directory.

For easier access, you can copy the executable to a directory in your system's PATH, such as /usr/local/bin/ or ~/.local/bin/:

```bash
sudo cp target/release/llm_globber /usr/local/bin/
# or
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cp target/release/llm_globber ~/.local/bin
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" # Add to your shell config file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc)
```

Alternatively, you can use cargo install to build and install the binary in ~/.cargo/bin (make sure ~/.cargo/bin is in your PATH):

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

### Examples

```bash
# Process all C source files in the current directory
llm_globber -o output -n c_sources -t .c .

# Process all files in a project directory recursively
llm_globber -o output -n project_files -a -r /path/to/project

# Process only files that match a specific pattern
llm_globber -o output -n config_files -N "*config*" /path/to/project

# Process specific files
llm_globber -o output -n important_files file1.c file2.h file3.txt

# Process files with verbose output
llm_globber -o output -n debug_files -v -r /path/to/project

# Process files silently (no output)
llm_globber -o output -n silent_run -q -r /path/to/project

# Abort on error
llm_globber -o output -n strict_run -e -r /path/to/project

# Include dot files
llm_globber -o output -n dotfile_run -d -r /path/to/config_dir

# Process a git repository (automatically uses tracked files)
llm_globber --git /path/to/repo -o output
llm_globber --git https://github.com/ttulttul/llm-globber -o output
```

### Git Integration

When using the `--git` option, LLM Globber automatically:

1. Downloads the git repository if a URL was provided
2. Verifies the path is a valid git repository
3. Uses the repository name and branch for the output filename
4. Processes only tracked files in the repository
5. Maintains the repository's directory structure in the output

This is especially useful for preparing codebases for LLM analysis:

```bash
# Process a git repository with default settings
llm_globber --git /path/to/repo -o output

# Process a git repository with specific file types
llm_globber --git /path/to/repo -o output -t .py,.js,.html

# Process a git repository with verbose output
llm_globber --git /path/to/repo -o output -v

# Download a git repository
llm_globber --git https://github.com/ttulttul/llm-globber -o output
```

## Unglob Mode

LLM Globber can extract files from a previously generated output file using the `--unglob` option:

```bash
# Extract files from a globbed file
llm_globber -u globbed_file.txt -o extracted_files

# Extract files with signature verification
llm_globber -u globbed_file.txt -o extracted_files --signature
```

This is useful for:
- Sharing code with collaborators who need the original file structure
- Extracting specific files from a large collection
- Restoring files from a backup
- Securely sharing files with tamper protection (when using `--signature`)
## Safety Features

- **Memory Safety:** Implemented in Rust, ensuring memory safety and preventing common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.
- **Path Sanitization:** Sanitizes input paths to prevent directory traversal attacks, including checks for null bytes and empty paths.
- **Binary File Detection:** Detects and handles binary files safely, preventing output corruption by omitting binary content.
- **Dot File Warnings:** Provides warnings when including dot files to remind users about potentially sensitive hidden files.
- **Secure File Permissions:** Sets restrictive permissions (0600) on output files to protect sensitive data.
- **Cryptographic Signatures:** Optional ed25519 signatures for file content integrity verification, protecting against tampering when files are shared.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage issues during file processing and provide informative error messages.

## Cryptographic Signatures

LLM Globber includes an optional cryptographic signature system to ensure file integrity when sharing code or documentation:

### How It Works

1. **Signing Mode**: When using `--signature` with normal globbing:
   - A new ed25519 keypair is generated for each run
   - The public key is stored at the beginning of the output file
   - Each file's content is signed with the private key
   - Signatures are stored in the file headers

2. **Verification Mode**: When using `--signature` with unglobbing:
   - The public key is extracted from the input file
   - Each file's signature is verified before extraction
   - Files with invalid signatures are rejected
   - This prevents tampering with the content between creation and extraction

### Security Benefits

- **Tamper Detection**: Any modification to file content after globbing will be detected
- **Integrity Verification**: Ensures files are extracted exactly as they were originally globbed
- **Cryptographic Strength**: Uses ed25519, a modern and secure signature algorithm

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Create a globbed file with signatures
llm_globber -o output -n secure_code --signature -r /path/to/code

# Extract files with signature verification
llm_globber -u output/secure_code_1234567890.txt -o extracted --signature
```

## Performance Optimizations

- **Efficient File I/O:** Utilizes BufReader and BufWriter for efficient buffered input and output operations.
- **Memory Mapping (mmap):** Employs memory mapping for processing large files, reducing memory overhead and improving speed.
- **Streaming File Processing:** Processes files in a streaming manner, minimizing memory usage, especially for large files.
- **Optimized String Handling:** Leverages Rust's efficient string processing capabilities.
- **Parallel Processing (Future):** Although the current version uses a single thread, the codebase is structured to be easily extensible for parallel processing in future versions, if needed.

## Output Format

The output file will have the following format:

```
'''--- file1.c ---
[Contents of file1.c]
'''

'''--- file2.h ---
[Contents of file2.h]
'''

...
```

When using the `--signature` option, the output includes cryptographic signatures:

```
'''--- PUBLIC_KEY --- [KEY:base64EncodedPublicKey]
'''

'''--- file1.c --- [SIGNATURE:base64EncodedSignature]
[Contents of file1.c]
'''

'''--- file2.h --- [SIGNATURE:base64EncodedSignature]
[Contents of file2.h]
'''

...
```

Each file's content is enclosed within `'''--- <filepath> ---` and `'''` markers, making it easy to parse and identify individual file contents. An extra blank line is added after each file block for better readability.

## Testing

The project includes a test suite located in the `tests/` directory. The tests are written in Bash and utilize a common helper script `tests/test_common.sh`.

To run the full test suite:

```bash
make tests
```

This script will execute individual test files (e.g., `test_basic.sh`, `test_recursive.sh`, `test_signature.sh`, etc.) and report a summary of the results.

The test suite covers various functionalities, including:
- Basic file globbing
- Recursive processing
- File type filtering
- Name pattern filtering
- Dotfile handling
- Verbose and quiet modes
- Unglobbing (file extraction)
- Signature generation and verification
- Git repository integration

## Binary File Handling

When a binary file is detected, its contents are not included in the output file. Instead, the output file will contain:

```
'''--- binary_file.bin ---
[Binary file - contents omitted]
'''
```

This ensures that the output file remains a clean text file, suitable for LLM ingestion, and avoids potential issues with binary data in text-based models.
